    The browser is the bridge between the user interface and the rendering engine. It is able to interpret and execute code embedded in the website for display.

     My experience with the way back machine was an eye-opening one. Browsers have come so far and they looked very simple when it was just starting out. Browsers came about around the year of my birth and I can remember some of the early browser pages and how little functionality they had. Nowadays you don't see as much of the coding itself but a representation of what that coding has depicted for us.
