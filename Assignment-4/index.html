<div id="lyrics" class="container">
I know a secret spot just for us<br>
Where you can see the city perfectly<br>
We don't have to do drugs, kiss, or touch<br>
But if you want to, that works for me<br>
We can both pretend it's the first time<br>
Like we don't know what heartbreak feels like<br>
Like we ain't ever watched everything we<br>
love burn to the ground Yeah, that'd be real nice<br>
Look at the lights<br>
I wonder if anyone sees us from all the way out there<br>
Probably not<br>
So, whatcha waitin' on?<br>
Go head, let it out now, I ain't scared<br>
I got demons too, if you even knew<br>
Probably the only reason I believe in you<br>
I know what they look like<br>
And you've got the look like you've got somethin'<br>
<br>
Stuck inside<br>
They slicin' up your heart like pumpkin pie<br>
It must be scrumptious, everyone just wants to try<br>
Until there's nothing left and, yet, they wonder why<br>
You run and hide (there's somethin' eating you alive)<br>
Cause there's somethin' eating you alive<br>
Alive<br>
Cause there's somethin' eating you alive<br>
<br>
It's in the eyes, it's in the eyes<br>
Even through a mask, they cannot be disguised<br>
They are windows into your insides<br>
And they say you haven't really been fine<br>
Here's an idea to bring us in tighter<br>
I'm sick of being empty, you sick of being tired<br>
I want to feel warmer, you want to see a fire<br>
I'm soaked in gasoline, you -- go head and drop the lighter<br>
Now, here's a chance baby<br>
I'm sittin' right beside ya<br>
You cannot hold me down, but, I like the way you try to<br>
So, push a little harder, squeeze a little tighter<br>
It drives me crazy the way you let the crazy drive you<br>
I see me and you, you see you and me<br>
I say we pretend this is just a lucid dream<br>
Cause you deserve a good night<br>
Cause you've got the look like you've got somethin'<br>
<br>
Stuck inside<br>
They slicin' up your heart like pumpkin pie<br>
It must be scrumptious, everyone just wants to try<br>
Until there's nothing left and, yet, they wonder why<br>
You run and hide (there's somethin' eating you alive)<br>
Cause there's somethin' eating you alive<br>
Alive<br>
Cause there's somethin' eating you alive</div>
