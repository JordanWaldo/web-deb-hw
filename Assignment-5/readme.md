I chose my design research to be from the 1960s. I picked out three graphics that were provided and blended well into the overall design. I decided to have five main sections to style my page and colors that worked well together on the color palette.

 I picked light yellow, light blue and orange for my color palette. I ended up using a purple background for the best blend.

I enjoyed the work for this assignment because it was a challenge. It took me a while to get everything to start showing up and recognizing the tags. It also took me a while to figure out the color scheme that I wanted but finally found something that worked out. Overall I thought it was a great first assignment for getting CSS.
