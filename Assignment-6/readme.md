I chose my design to be from Friday Night Lights because I am a huge fan of the book. I chose to use Cinzel font because I thought it would work well for this assignment.

The difference is that a desktop font is used and installed on your computer and used with applicatiions on your computer. A webfont is used for web pages and helps it render correctly. Web safe fonts are pre-installed by oberating systems to allow seamless support.

I enjoyed the work for this assignment because it was a challenge. It took me a while to get everything to start showing up and recognizing the tags. I look forward to our final project and am going to get started on that now.
