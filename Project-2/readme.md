Up until this point I have enjoyed learning HTML. I had a slow start but things are looking great and I am learning new things every week. I really enjoyed making tags and linking pages to one another.

I am anxious and excited to start in CSS to expand in styling of our websites. I have very little experience in this area and want to dig into it more.

This assignment was much more challenging than the last few. I did have a few issues when I was phishing to GitHub. The best part of the assignment was making the pages and linking them together. I found this difficult but manageable after watching the tutorials.
