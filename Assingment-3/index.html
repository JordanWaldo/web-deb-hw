   <blockquote>Pumpkin and spice star in a melt-in-your-mouth cookie topped with a special homemade frosting.</blockquote>
  <h2> Ingredients </h2>
   <h3>Cookies:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar
    <li>2/3 cup brown sugar
    <li>3/4 cup butter
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla
    <li>1/2 cup pumpkin
    <li>2 1/4 cups flour
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda
    <li>1/2 salt
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</ul>
   <h3>Browned Butter Frosting:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla
    <li>3 cups powdered sugar
    <li>4 tablespoons milk
    <li>1/3 cup butter
</ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Heat oven to 375Â°F. In large bowl, beat granulated sugar, brown sugar, 3/4 cup butter and 1 teaspoon vanilla with electric mixer on medium speed, scraping bowl occasionally, until well blended. Beat in pumpkin and eggs until well mixed. On low speed, beat in flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt.
  <li>On ungreased cookie sheets, drop dough by heaping tablespoonfuls.
  <li>Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until almost no indentation remains when touched in center. Immediately remove from cookie sheets to cooling rack. Cool completely, about 45 minutes.
  <li>In medium bowl, place powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 3 tablespoons milk. In 1-quart saucepan, heat 1/3 cup butter over medium heat, stirring constantly, just until light brown.
  <li>Pour browned butter over powdered sugar mixture. Beat on low speed about 1 minute or until smooth. Gradually add just enough of the remaining 1 tablespoon milk to make frosting creamy and spreadable. Generously frost cooled cookies.
