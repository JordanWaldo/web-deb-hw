    The browser is the bridge between the user interface and the rendering engine. It is able to interpret and execute code embedded in the website for display.

     My experience with the way back machine was an eye-opening one. Browsers have come so far and they looked very simple when it was just starting out. Browsers came about around the year of my birth and I can remember some of the early browser pages and how little functionality they had. Nowadays you don't see as much of the coding itself but a representation of what that coding has depicted for us.

 I really enjoyed our project one assignment.  While I didn't necessarily feel there was a lot of new information here, it was very good practice and much-needed. Working with our repository online has been a challenge for me but I feel I'm slowly getting the hang of it. I did experience one problem with this assignment in the images section.  I wasn't able to get my image to show on a browser and I am currently still working on it. I am going to try a new photo and see if that works. the problem still persists I will post a problem to the discussion forum and see if anyone has any advice.
