Padding is the space that is inside of your element between the border and element. Padding connects with all four sides of your content and is utilized in css. The space outside ofthe border and the next element is the Margin. Borders allow you to set the style for different elements.

The hardest part of this project was getting my sizing and placement correctly. It took me a while to figure out absolute position in my elements.

This final project was challenging and I am currently still working on it before the deadline. I was able to better understand the tags from html to css. I was also finally able to get a font to correctly be embeded into my work. I found a few relevant photos and followed step by step in the instructions. I messed with the font for about an hour and almost gave up. I will get back to that now to perfect it. I did notice that my backround photo is a little larger than I wanted it to be and haven't figured out how to have this auto size if that is possible, I have tried many solutions with zero luck.
